          <h3>Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>

              <p>In my personal experience, previously working as a systems administrator, I learnt just how undeniably integral IT is to modern business.
              
              E-mail alone makes it difficult to gloss over the impact modern technology has had on business. The sheer power of instantaneous and global communication allows businesses to thrive like never before. The popularity of e-mail has inspired countless alternatives for business facing communication such as Slack & Discord. 
              
              </p>
              <p>Although I was primarily responsible for the maintenance of hardware, I also oversaw and managed the company’s database software; “Gnomen”.
              
              The business managed over 100 properties and while paper records were of course kept, almost all record keeping first went through this database, simply due to how easy it was to both input as well as access at a later date. Not to mention that once data has been input digitally, it can be copied infinitely helping to ensure data loss.
              
              </p>
              <p>
              While the massive boost to communication ability as well as file sharing & storage are the most obvious influences IT has had on modern business culture; security completes the triangle. Granted, the cyberworld adds an additional layer of risk to business management, it also comes with it added layers of insurance and security.
              
              Gone are the days of losing your paper records and being ruined as a result. Passwords as well as new advances in key & lock technology are slowly replacing traditional locksmithing. 
            </p>

            <h3>Describing methods, skills and resources
            needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>
            
          <p>When it comes to completing projects digitally, communication is key. In my experience working on digital projects, Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code is by far the most useful code editor available due to their liveshare function. 
          <p> 
            While it is not free from issues, it allows team members to instantly share their code in real time. Coupled with any basic voice chat functionality (discord) and it almost feels like being in the same room as someone.
            <p>
            On the topic of code, i’d dare to say that a customized command line (you can link VS code to your terminal), as well as general skill and understanding of the command line can go along way, too.
          </p>
         
         <p>
          Naturally, project management tools such as Trello are invaluable for assigning and delegating tasks as well as managing one’s own workload. Going one step further, Toggl(hyperlink me) is an excellent service to help manage one’s time while working remotely. When I dabbled in web design Toggl was the primary method by which we would log our hours for invoicing clients. 
        </p>
            <p>
            When thinking of project management skills, ‘flowcharts’ come to mind instantly and while studying with Code Nation I was introduced to the concept of ‘stand ups’ as well as draw.io.

          <h3>Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h3>
          <p>I will be planning the design of my website by firstly noting down all of the tasks that need doing and resources required in a rough fashion:	
          </p>
          <p>
              tasks: acquire webspace (host/domain), design layout & position of elements, choose colour scheme, write content, basic SEO
              resources: github, trello, smallseotools, VS code, vue.js (?), graphics editor. 
        </p>
        <p>
              I will be using Trello to organize tasks using the Kanban style of project management that I learnt through my course with CodeNation. Github will serve as the webspace. After basic functionality is achieved I will begin to work on designing the layout and artistic elements of the site by first researching other examples

            <h3>Describe the risks that might impact digital
            projects –</h3>
            <p>The digital world is constantly changing. With a vast array of software seeing frequent updates and changes as well as new applications being developed almost daily, the landscape is ever-shifting. Add to this the greatest risk factor of all - unknowns. The digital world is full of unquantifiable and unpredictable elements, impossible to prepare for or anticipate so it’s easy to see why a digital project might go awry.

                The most obvious risks being tied to cost estimation, scheduling and build specifics for the project, additionally there are legal risks, risks associated with going to market, and lastly each individual team member carries with him or her a set of unique risks.

         <h3>Describe how you would go about selecting
and using IT systems and software – </h3>
<p>

When it comes to a decision as complicated as which technology to use, it’s critical to first think about the product and the user. For example, a large portion of the population access the internet through their mobile phone exclusively so any website would have to be android or iphone responsive. However, having said that Blizzard Entertainment, a world-renowned gaming company saw huge profit loss because of an attempt to release a major product release for mobile when their main user base primarily use PCs. Headlines read “Blizzard team ‘booed’ at Blizzcon 2018 for Diablo announcement” and the backlash surprised the entire development team. Yes Blizzard followed the market trends but they misunderstood their users and paid dearly for it. 
</p>
<p>
With any tech release, security is paramount, pretty much anyone regardless of their coding ability can hire large botnets and use them to perform DDoS attacks and flood a target with hundreds of gigabytes of data. But we need to know what we have to secure before we can decide how to secure it. 
</p>
<p>
Speed of progression in the digital world has rapidly increased. No longer can we expect to be using the same operating systems, software or even hardware in as little as 5 years time. That’s why when it comes to develop we have to think granular, in little packages and in separation of concerns. The ability to swap packages and technologies in and out with flexibility is becoming increasingly ever more important.

          These past two weeks working on several python projects I have been coding on the ThinkPad by Lenovo. Personally, I’ve found them to be a delight: compact, lightweight, with a responsive keyboard and clear screen. The battery life leaves a lot to be desired but as a trade-off they charge extremely quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
          Using Trello was invaluable for my team to assign tasks and manage the development of our game: Shadow of the Necromancer. A fun text-based adventure for which I had the pleasure of developing a lightweight gambling game based on Blackjack, as well as debugging which I found that I actually really enjoy doing.
          </p>
          <p>
          Draw.io was a website we used to manage our flowchart and design the structure for the game which, was indeed very useful. Despite that however I found the creation of charts through the site to be tedious and wonder if the same result couldn’t be achieved with just paint for less trouble. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Of course, I can’t discuss the collaborative effort I made with my team without discussing Slack: which allowed us to communicate with a team member who was absent at a critical time and in doing so, complete our game and fix a number of errors - as well as share code with ease.

          Git has been gaining massive traction in recent years as ‘the’ version control system. The software’s invaluable service renders the old methods of copy and pasting old code into notepad documents to store them ‘just in case’ entirely obsolete - offering the fluid capability to transition between previous versions at will. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Github - a popular repository built upon the foundations of Git software allows developers like myself to view & share code, manage past versions and collaborate with others. Which it goes without saying will allow me to connect and coordinate with my team effectively and seamlessly.

          <h3> Describe legal guidelines and constraints that
            impact digital projects (GDPR) –</h3>
  
            <p>
              The biggest impact from my perspective stems from the risk of the financial sanctions a business could face from failing to implement correct GDPR-standard compliance. Forcing any digital product from either withdrawing itself from collecting data of any kind or ensuring it complies with the GDPR.
              </p>
                  <p>
                      The law gives the users of any digital product or website the right to access any data being held on them. Combined with other critical components such as having to actively opt-in to giving up your data, gone is the old approach of data hoarding ‘just in case’. 
                  </p>
  
                  <h4>The 8 basic rights of GDPR</h4>
                  <ol>
  
                    <li>The right to access </li>
                    <li>The right to be forgotten</li>
                    <li>The right to data portability</li>
  <li>The right to be informed </li>
  <li> right to have information corrected</li>
  <li>The right to restrict processing</li> 
  <li>The right to object</li>
  <li>The right to be notified</li> [1]
  </ol>  
 
  <p>
  It is at least safe to say that for any business now, data flows will have to be regulated, minimized and monitored and software developers will be required to understand at least the basic legislation,  
  </p>

 <blockquote><i>“for example, they will need to know about the rule of “data protection by design and by default,” referring to  the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which is necessary for each specific purpose of the processing is processed.” </i> [2]
