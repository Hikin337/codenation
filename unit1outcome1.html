          <h3>Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>

              <p>In my personal experience, previously working as a systems administrator, I learnt just how undeniably integral IT is to modern business.
              
              E-mail alone makes it difficult to gloss over the impact modern technology has had on business. The sheer power of instantaneous and global communication allows businesses to thrive like never before. The popularity of e-mail has inspired countless alternatives for business facing communication such as Slack & Discord. 
              
              </p>
              <p>Although I was primarily responsible for the maintenance of hardware, I also oversaw and managed the company’s database software; “Gnomen”.
              
              The business managed over 100 properties and while paper records were of course kept, almost all record keeping first went through this database, simply due to how easy it was to both input as well as access at a later date. Not to mention that once data has been input digitally, it can be copied infinitely helping to ensure data loss.
              
              </p>
              <p>
              While the massive boost to communication ability as well as file sharing & storage are the most obvious influences IT has had on modern business culture; security completes the triangle. Granted, the cyberworld adds an additional layer of risk to business management, it also comes with it added layers of insurance and security.
              
              Gone are the days of losing your paper records and being ruined as a result. Passwords as well as new advances in key & lock technology are slowly replacing traditional locksmithing.

            <h3>Describing methods, skills and resources
            needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>
            
          <p>When it comes to completing projects digitally, communication is key. In my experience working on digital projects, Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code is by far the most useful code editor available due to their liveshare function. 
          <p> 
            While it is not free from issues, it allows team members to instantly share their code in real time. Coupled with any basic voice chat functionality (discord) and it almost feels like being in the same room as someone.
            <p>
            On the topic of code, i’d dare to say that a customized command line (you can link VS code to your terminal), as well as general skill and understanding of the command line can go along way, too.
          </p>
         
         <p>
          Naturally, project management tools such as Trello are invaluable for assigning and delegating tasks as well as managing one’s own workload. Going one step further, Toggl(hyperlink me) is an excellent service to help manage one’s time while working remotely. When I dabbled in web design Toggl was the primary method by which we would log our hours for invoicing clients. 
        </p>
            <p>
            When thinking of project management skills, ‘flowcharts’ come to mind instantly and while studying with Code Nation I was introduced to the concept of ‘stand ups’ as well as draw.io.

          <h3>Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h3>
          <p>I will be planning the design of my website by firstly noting down all of the tasks that need doing and resources required in a rough fashion:	
          </p>
          <p>
              tasks: acquire webspace (host/domain), design layout & position of elements, choose colour scheme, write content, basic SEO
              resources: github, trello, smallseotools, VS code, vue.js (?), graphics editor. 
        </p>
        <p>
              I will be using Trello to organize tasks using the Kanban style of project management that I learnt through my course with CodeNation. Github will serve as the webspace. After basic functionality is achieved I will begin to work on designing the layout and artistic elements of the site by first researching other examples

            <h3>Describe the risks that might impact digital
            projects –</h3>
            <p>The digital world is constantly changing. With a vast array of software seeing frequent updates and changes as well as new applications being developed almost daily, the landscape is ever-shifting. Add to this the greatest risk factor of all - unknowns. The digital world is full of unquantifiable and unpredictable elements, impossible to prepare for or anticipate it’s easy to see where a digital project might go awry.

                The most obvious risks being tied to cost estimation, scheduling and build specifics for the project, additionally there are legal risks, risks associated with going to the market, each individual team member carries with him or her a set of unique risks.
