          <h3>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
           </h3> <p>
              Having used both Trello and Visual Studio Code before I was perfectly comfortable and happy using them to develop my website. I’ve personally found Trello intuitive and expedient. Additionally Visual Studio Code is my personally preferred Code Editor. From the aesthetic to the functionality, I am an avid supporter. What’s more is that I made use of Code Pen to find great code examples I could learn from and incorporate into my site.

          <h3>  Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h3>
            
           <p> Both Trello and VS Code were more than expedient. I had to take my project work home and to do so I used Git from the terminal to init and push my project and then clone it on my personal work-station. Trello was a fantastic tool for helping me stay on task and not forget both what I had already accomplished as well as the fine tuning that I had to push back in favor of higher priority tasks.

            <h3>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h3>
            <p>
As a website it is clearly laid out and stylish in design. I also find the colour scheme to be pleasant and yet captivating. Most important of all, my entire site is completely responsive except for the .gif images. Overall I am quite pleased with the final product but not entirely satisfied. I had many designs and ideas that I failed to bring to fruition such as moving .gif images, animated transitions, animated home buttons / navigation bars.

              <h3>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
              
              <p>I would very much like to learn and incorporate CSS Grids or frameworks to assist me with managing the grid such as Bootstrap.js. Unfortunately my attempt to learn the Grid was postponed as I felt very rushed to produce a finished website that was both functional, beautiful and representative of my full potential as a developer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Beyond the grid I would have liked to incorporate more artistic elements such as banners, borders and animations without losing the minimalistic style of the site. 
              </p>
                <p>I would like to add a condition where if the user is hovering over a link then the flower animation will not occur and the user won't have to adapt their clicking style to my site </p>

              <h3>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose

                <p> After reviewing the checklist for the entire written coursework required, I can safely confirm that all outcomes have been completed and are adequately suitable. </p>
