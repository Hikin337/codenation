           <h3>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of
            productivity and efficiency </h3>
            <p>
            Although I respect and value efficiency highly, I believe there was more that could have been done to achieve an optimal build. Having someone assist me with proof-checking and debugging could have possibly produced a faster and more complete site.
          </p><p>
            I built several drafts of my site before I finally settled on the submitted design and structure, mainly because I attempted to code the site by hand before resorting to making use of research as well as over-ambition by trying to build my site through the Quasar framework before I fully understood or read the documentation. 
          </p></div>
        <div class="tabBlock-pane">
           <h3> Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
            <p>
            Beginning with the physical drawbacks that I suffered building my site - a watercooler nearby would have meant fewer and shorter trips to fetch much needed water. Additionally proper and comfortable seating to help reduce pain and increase morale. 
          </p><p>
            Personal chargers for the Thinkpads as there was some issue among all members of the course when it came to charging and maintaining battery life. If not that then a fully stacked desktop Tower complete with two monitors for advanced multi-tasking.

        <div class="tabBlock-pane">
           <h3>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3>
           <p>I would most definitely attempt again to build the site through a proper framework as most websites are built today. I would make use of Toggl to plan and dictate the time slots for each task and component of the build. </p>
           <p>Although I enjoy Slack and I will continue to use it, if I was working with a team I would also create a Discord channel for voice communications. However, both Slack and Discord suffer from the same issue when it comes to pinned resources - they become difficult to organize and scrolling through text to find a specific pdf or piece of code is very unproductive and inefficient. I believe even google docs, Github or an actual site would serve as a more efficient repository for resources.

             <h3>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
            <p>
            For websites particularly, testing in all mainstream browsers is an important first-step: chrome, firefox, IE, Opera, etc. 
          </p><p>
              Testing responsivity for mobile is also crucial. Quick tests can be done easily by resizing the window. 
            </p><p>
              Code testing before implementation using Git or other more basic manual techniques as well as making use of isolated environments such as Code Pen.
