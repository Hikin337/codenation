       <h3>Describing the content and layout for each page </h3>
          <p> A page with an about me section detailing my basic character portfolio serves as my home page </p>
          <p> The top border of the site is occupied by 4 buttons, coded in .css with an added animation effect for style</p>
          <p> Beneath which is a section specifically designed to handle the outcomes and the large number. I knew that I wanted to do a 2x2 layout with page changes for the units and tab switching for the outcomes</p>
          <p>For bonus style there is a click effect where petals will fall from the cursor. Because of this however, typical single clicking of links does not work and as such the user has to hold the mouse button down for a split second and activate the link by releasing - not pressing</p>
          <p> Along the footer sits three buttons designed to take you back to index.html, to my github page and to the top of the current page. </p>
          <p> Lastly there are several images of fighting game characters, Yuzuriha, Hazama, Gordeau and Es. One of them is actually not a playable character and is only seen with Byakuya (who is)

          <h3>Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h3>

         <p> Cataloging the different rights contained within a website can be an enormous feat. Although websites themselves are not a kind of ‘copyright work’, code, images, text could all be protected in under various respective copyrights.</p> 
          
         <p> Since ideas themselves outside of work with an appropriate copyright can’t be protected, guarding the design or layout of a website appears unfeasible.
          </p><p>
          The copyright symbol - the one that populated every single website during the 1990s through to the 2000s is no longer as important thanks to the Berne convention. Although it still retains that sleek professional look and helps to inform any parties who wish to contact the copyright holder who actually holds the rights. 
        </p><p>
          Unless infringement is on a large or business scale, it is not usually considered a crime in the UK.

            <h3>Describing access issues that need taking into account </h3>
<P>
Although many issues caused by disabilities are alleviated greatly by hardware modifications - as web developers there is a responsibility to ensure that websites are presented in clear and organized formats as well as adhering to basic principles so as to minimize the difficulties faced by those who suffer from visual, physical, hearing, cognitive or neurological disabilities. 
          </P>
<p>
For new developers making a site visual impairment friendly is easy to forget but can render your site entirely unusable to those with:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>Blindness</li>
<li>Low vision </li>
<li>Colour blindness</li>
</ul>
<p>
As a rule of thumb, whenever you insert a picture you want to add an ‘alt tag’ so that anyone using a screen reader can still understand what the picture represents. 
</p>
<p>
It's good to remember that no matter the position of elements, the underlying HTML markup should be organized and make sense when read from top to bottom. This is how users with visual impairments (who rely on assistive devices like screen readers) access your content.
</p>
<p>
Some people with color blindness may have to configure their own style sheets so that the contrast you’ve styled in doesn’t prevent them from reading your site. 
</p>
<p>
Hearing impairments range from deafness to loss of hearing and some people with complete hearing loss may speak sign language as their first language and not be able to read natively making text-heavy sites a chore to peruse.
</p>
<p>
Speech and physical difficulties clashing with basic web design are significantly rarer instances which makes them easier to overlook. People with motor impairments may not be able to press certain keystroke combinations or struggle to tab through your website if it is poorly laid out.

 <h3>
              Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
              <p>
The most common file type on a web server is  a html or htm file. Index.html stands for the default page for the site and some servers do use default.html. 
</p><p>
abc.com/index.html and abc.com are the same thing
</p><p>
For images, the most common are .gif, .jpg (jpeg) or .png - there are slight differences between each with jpg files being better for photographic images, gif files offering the ability to index colors to ensure they are web safe as well as allowing animations and png have better compression, color and transparency. 
</p><p>
.cgi stands for common gateway interface and this file will run on the web server and interact with the web user.
</p><p>
.js stands for javascript and you will see this if the developer is loading his javascript externally.
</p><p>
.php is another common file extension for web development. A web scripting program that brings macros, includes and scripting to your site.
</p><br>
